# maven-project
Anypoint DevOps:

This project is a maven-based Mule project, with source managed in Git, continuously integrated using Jenkins, and tested with MUnit.  The class ended without completing module 4, but was an awesome look at Mule Studio and the seemless integration with other tools.

Shout out to Gopal E. at Mulesoft for giving possibly one of the best IT courses I've ever taken.
